📌 About This Project

This is my personal portfolio website created as part of a club weekly activity. The goal was to build and host a professional portfolio that showcases my skills, projects, and basic information.

To save time on layout and responsiveness, I used a HTML5 UP template as a base and then customized it extensively to suit my profile and requirements.

⚙️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. Understanding the template structure
The template had multiple files and sections. I explored the HTML and CSS step by step to understand how components were linked.

2. Making the contact form work
Since there was no backend, I used Formspree to handle form submissions.

3. Deployment issues
Initially faced issues with GitHub Pages settings, which I resolved by configuring the correct branch and pushing updates properly.
